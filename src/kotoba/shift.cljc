(ns kotoba.shift
  "Attendance: punches, shifts, rosters, coverage — pure data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library for the 打刻 / rostering half of
  workforce management (the UKG / Dayforce / ADP / Deputy / QuickBooks
  Time category), covering what those products call time & attendance:
  turning clock events into worked spans, planned shifts into a roster,
  and demand into coverage.

  It is the sibling of `kotoba.activity`, and the difference is what the
  data means rather than how it is shaped. Activity capture SAMPLES —
  it asks 'what was in front of you just now' many times. Attendance
  RECORDS — a punch is a deliberate assertion that a shift began. So
  activity segments a stream and undercounts by a sample interval; this
  pairs discrete events and refuses to complete an unpaired one.

  The statutory side is not here. `kotoba.worklaw` holds the
  jurisdiction rules, because they apply to worked time from any source,
  not just from punches.

  One invariant runs through all of it, and it is the same one
  `kotoba.activity` holds for a different reason:

    An unpaired punch is never completed. A missing clock-out does not
    become 'end of shift', 'end of day' or 'now'. It becomes an anomaly
    with no worked time attached, because the alternative is inventing
    the most consequential number on the timesheet.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM."

  "Fold one person's punches into worked spans and anomalies.

  Returns `{:worked [...] :anomalies [{:anomaly/rule :anomaly/at ...}]}`.

  Anomalies, none of which produce worked time:
    :double-in       — a second :in while already clocked in
    :out-without-in  — an :out with no open :in
    :missing-out     — the day ends with an :in still open
    :break-outside   — a break punch while clocked out
    :double-break    — a :break-start while already on break
    :unclosed-break  — a :break-start with no :break-end before the :out

  Punches at the same instant are ordered :out, :break-end, :break-start,
  :in — so a shift that ends exactly as the next begins pairs correctly
  instead of reading as a double clock-in. The consequence, which is a
  real one: an :in and an :out stamped at the SAME instant read as
  `:out-without-in` followed by `:missing-out`, not as a zero-length
  shift. Both readings say the terminal recorded something impossible;
  this one says it without having to invent an ordering the data does
  not contain.

  A shift with an unclosed break is NOT silently credited the whole span:
  the break is dropped from the pairing and the span is reported as an
  anomaly instead, since 'how long was the break' is exactly the number
  nobody can reconstruct after the fact."
